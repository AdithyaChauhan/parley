# Parley: Learning Notes

One section per task. Claude Code drafts the "What was built" part. Adithya writes "In my words" himself; a task isn't done until that part is filled in.

## Template (copy for each task)

### Task N: name
**What was built**
- `path/to/file`: what the file is for.
  - `function_name()`: what it does and why it exists.

**New ideas**
- Each new word or tool, in one plain sentence.

**In my words** (Adithya writes this)
- What this task does, as if explaining to an interviewer:
- What I'd check first if it broke:
- What still confuses me:

### Task 1: Repo and plan files
**What was built**
- `PLAN.md`: every task in order, plus the brief for the current one.
- `DECISIONS.md`: every big choice and why, so nobody suggests something that clashes.
- `LEARNING.md`: this file.
- `CLAUDE.md`: rules Claude Code reads at the start of every session.

**New ideas**
- Branch: a separate copy of the code to work on one task without breaking `main`.
- Pull request: a request to merge a branch into `main`, where the changes get reviewed first.
- Plan mode: a Claude Code mode where it reads and proposes but can't change files.

**In my words**
- What this task does: 3 files claude.md(rules for claude code) decisions.md(every major change to avoid conflct) and plan.md(task in order + brief for curr task)
- Why two Claudes need shared files: so that each can bring up issues it faces which contradicts the plan so it can understand and make ammends.
- What still confuses me: None
